                        <li style="text-align: left; max-width: 1000px;">For this project, we developed a Java program simulating the card game "SET" using object-oriented principles. 
                        The implementation required designing classes and utilizing advanced Java concepts such as threads and synchronization to handle concurrency issues. 
                        Through this, I deepened my understanding of multithreading, synchronization, and the Java Collections Framework. 
                        Additionally, I gained valuable experience in collaborative programming, as the assignment was completed in a pair.</li>

                    <li style="text-align: left; max-width: 1000px;">For this project, we developed a Java program that extracts collocations from a given large database using the MapReduce framework. 
                        The implementation required designing a MapReduce job and utilizing Amazon Elastic MapReduce to process large datasets efficiently. We designed 4 steps for the MapReduce job, each with a different purpose.
                        Through this, I deepened my understanding of distributed systems, cloud computing, and the MapReduce paradigm. 
                        Additionally, I gained valuable experience in working with big data and utilizing cloud services (AWS) to optimize performance.</li>

                        <li style="text-align: left; max-width: 1000px;">For this project, we developed a Java program that parses sarcasm in comments using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform.
                        The implementation required designing a distributed system and using AWS services such as S3, SQS, and EC2 to efficiently process and analyze large data sets. The project was built in three parts: administrator, client, and worker. The ultimate goal is for everyone to work together.
                        Through this, I deepened my understanding of cloud computing, distributed systems, and the AWS ecosystem.
