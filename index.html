                        <li style="text-align: left; max-width: 1000px;"><strong>Description:</strong>
                            For this project, we developed a Java program simulating the card game "SET" using object-oriented principles. 
                            The implementation required designing well-structured classes and utilizing advanced Java concepts, including threads and synchronization, to handle concurrency issues effectively. 
                            The program also incorporated the Java Collections Framework for efficient data management and processing. </li>                         
                            <li style="text-align: left; max-width: 1000px;"><strong>Achievements:</strong>
                            Through this project, I deepened my understanding of multithreading, synchronization, and the Java Collections Framework. I also honed my problem-solving skills by addressing concurrency challenges and gained valuable experience in collaborative programming, as the assignment was completed in a pair. This enhanced my ability to communicate effectively and work as part of a team.</li>

                        For this project, we developed a Java program to extract collocations from a large database using the MapReduce framework. The implementation involved designing and executing a four-step MapReduce job on Amazon Elastic MapReduce (AWS EMR) to process and analyze the Google 2gram dataset efficiently. Each step in the process had a specific purpose to ensure accurate and meaningful results, such as extracting collocations and calculating normalized PMI.</li>                         
                        <li style="text-align: left; max-width: 1000px;"><strong>Achievements:</strong>
                            Through this project, I successfully processed a large dataset and deepened my understanding of distributed systems, cloud computing, and the MapReduce paradigm. I gained hands-on experience in working with big data and utilizing AWS cloud services to optimize performance, enhancing my knowledge of distributed programming and cloud-based data processing.</li>

                            For this project, we developed a Java program to parse sarcasm in comments using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. 
                            The implementation involved designing a distributed system composed of three parts— Manager, Client, and Worker- that collaborated to serve as an application for processing and analyzing large datasets. 
                            AWS services, including S3 for storage, SQS for message queuing, and EC2 for computation, were utilized to ensure efficient processing and seamless system operation. 
                            Sentiment analysis and named entity recognition tools were applied to the data for accurate results.</li>
